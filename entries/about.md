CalVer is a software versioning convention based on calendar dates of
project releases, instead of arbitrary numbers. There are
[many benefits][designing_a_version] to this approach, and
[multiple variations][calver_overview] to custom fit all projects.

Calendar versioning has a long history, but CalVer itself was first
publicly released in 2016. The initial version was written by
[Mahmoud Hashemi][mahmoud], with thanks to
[Stephen LaPorte][stephen], [Mark Williams][mark],
[Glyph Lefkowitz][glyph], and [Hynek Schlawack][hynek].

If you have questions, comments, issues, or enhancements, please feel
free to [open an issue on the CalVer GitHub][issue].
